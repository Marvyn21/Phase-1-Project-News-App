# Phase-1-Project-News-App
This is a JavaScript program that fetches news articles from the News API and displays them on a web page. It uses HTML and CSS to create a user interface, and JavaScript to interact with the News API. Overall, this program is a simple example of how to use the News API to fetch and display news articles on a web page. It can be extended by adding more categories or by customizing the user interface.
This project is a news website that fetches data from the News API provided by saurav.tech. The website allows users to view news articles from different categories such as business, entertainment, health, science, sports, and technology. Users can select a category from the navbar by clicking on it and the website will display news articles from that category.

To run the project, you need to open the index.html file in a web browser. The website will automatically fetch the latest news articles from the default category general. If you want to view news articles from other categories, simply click on the category name in the navbar.

The project uses DOM manipulation and event listeners in JavaScript to dynamically update the website based on user actions. The website also utilizes some Bootstrap classes for styling, making it responsive and mobile-friendly.

The main files in the project are:

index.html: This is the main HTML file that displays the website.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that fetches data from the News API and updates the website.
style.css: This file contains the CSS code that styles the website.
The News API provided by saurav.tech requires an API key, which is stored in the script.js file. If you want to use your own API key, you can replace the existing key with your own.

Note: This project was built as part of the phase 1 curriculum of a programming course and is intended for educational purposes only. The project may contain bugs or other issues and should not be used in production environments.
